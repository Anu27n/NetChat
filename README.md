## Security and User Management
We've implemented strict rules for managing users across all types of chats in NetChat to ensure security and proper access control:

* **Automatic Memberships:**
   * Users cannot leave or be removed from chats they were automatically added to.

* **Private Conversations:**
   * Members cannot leave or be removed from their private conversations (DMs).

* **Administrative Control:**
   * Administrators have the highest level of control and can manage most user access.

* **Department-Specific:**
   * Members can only access chats that are directly relevant to their specific department.

* **User Engagement:**
   * Users receive automatic notifications for updates related to their chats.
